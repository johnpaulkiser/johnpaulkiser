# 🍜 HI, I'm JP
<br />

<br />
_Software developer, Bitcoin & open source enthusiast, drummer, and in desperate need of a mentor._
<br />
### 🎓 I'm currently finishing my BS in CS at USC Upstate in Spartanburg, SC, where I tutor programming and head the Computer Science Club.

### In my free time I'm working on *[StreamerCap](https://streamercap.com)*, a small web app that aggregates gaming livestreams from different sites to make the best streamers accessible from one place.
