**StreamerCap** is a web app that allows users to sort and filter videogame livestreams from multiple sites by various criteria. I found that using Twitch.tv's filtering tool to find new streams was not as feature rich as I would like. 
Twitch doesn't allow you to filter multiple games at a time, or do other additive filters. For example, on Twitch it's impossible to display all streamers who are playing either League of Legends _or_ Starcraft 2, speak either English _or_ Korean, _and_ who have been streaming for over 5 hours. That exact query, and many more, are possible on StreamerCap.
