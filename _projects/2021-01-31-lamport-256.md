**Lamport-256** is a _toy_ signature scheme library based on [Lamport Signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamport_signature). Since Lamport signatures
work by revealing the preimage to a hashed private key they are single use in nature, severely limiting their use cases. 

This library was written for fun to assist building toy blockchains. **DO NOT** use this in the wild. If you would like to contribute to this project please make a pull request on github.

* Implemented using `Python` & GitHub Actions
